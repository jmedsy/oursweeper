* `npm run start` will start your app in dev mode and start a dev server you can browse to
* `npm run build` will first run the TypeScript compiler `tsc` to type check, then run `vite`'s build to produce output HTML/JS/CSS for production.
* `npm run serve` will just serve a dev server, good for checking production builds.
